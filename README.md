# Rules

* The game board is a grid with squares that are either black or white.
* Custom starting points are okay.
* The ant starts at square ( 0, 0 ) and moves according to the following rules:
    - The ant will move right if the current square is white and will move left if current square is black.
    - The ant will always toggle the color of the current square (white to black or vice-versa) before leaving.
